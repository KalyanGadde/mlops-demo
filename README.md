# mlops-zcamp

This includes practical aspects of productionizing ML services — from training and experimenting to model deployment and monitoring.

This Git Repo includes step-by-step through each stage of the MLOps cycle starting from experimentation and model selection to model deployment to monitoring. In the concluding three weeks, you will apply your acquired knowledge and skills to develop an end-to-end machine learning project.

<image src="./images/image2.png" alt="mlops-demo"/>

### Objective

This includes practical aspects of productionizing ML services — from training and experimenting to model deployment and monitoring.

### Target audience

Data scientists, Site Reliability Engineers, Data Engineers and ML engineers. Also software engineers and data engineers interested in learning about putting ML in production.

### Pre-requisites
Based on the nature of the impmentation, it is required to have some experience towards on below technologies and coding.
* Python
* Docker
* Being comfortable with command line 
* Prior exposure to machine learning (at work or from other courses)
* Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)


## Syllabus

### [Module 1: Introduction]

* What is MLOps
* MLOps maturity model
* Running example: NY Taxi trips dataset
* Why do we need MLOps
* Course overview
* Environment preparation


### [Module 2: Experiment tracking and model management]

* Experiment tracking intro
* Getting started with MLflow
* Experiment tracking with MLflow
* Saving and loading models with MLflow
* Model registry
* MLflow in practice


### [Module 3: Orchestration and ML Pipelines]

* Workflow orchestration
* Mage



### [Module 4: Model Deployment]

* Three ways of model deployment: Online (web and streaming) and offline (batch)
* Web service: model deployment with Flask
* Streaming: consuming events with AWS Kinesis and Lambda
* Batch: scoring data offline



### [Module 5: Model Monitoring]

* Monitoring ML-based services
* Monitoring web services with Prometheus, Evidently, and Grafana
* Monitoring batch jobs with Prefect, MongoDB, and Evidently


### [Module 6: Best Practices]

* Testing: unit, integration
* Python: linting and formatting
* Pre-commit hooks and makefiles
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
* Infrastructure as code (Terraform)

### [Project]

* End-to-end project with all the things above
